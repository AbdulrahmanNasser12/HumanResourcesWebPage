<h1>Human resources Web page Frontend</h1>

<p>
  I have developed a front-end project that consists of two webpages designed for human resources purposes . The first webpage allows employees to submit vacation requests, while the second webpage is specifically designed for HR personnel to review and approve or decline these requests.

The project is built using popular web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By leveraging these languages, I have created an intuitive and user-friendly interface for employees to input their vacation details and submit their requests efficiently.

The HR webpage provides HR staff with a comprehensive overview of submitted vacation requests. They can review each request individually and make informed decisions regarding their approval or rejection. This streamlined process aims to enhance efficiency within the HR department and ensure timely responses to employee requests.
